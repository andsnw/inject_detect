<p>Welcome to Inject Detect!</p>

<p>Your first application, <%= @application.name %> is configured and ready to accept queries from your Meteor server.</p>

<p>At first, all queries we detect will automatically be marked as "expected queries". Once your application has performed all expected queries, turn off "training mode", and we'll start watching for unexpected queries.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
